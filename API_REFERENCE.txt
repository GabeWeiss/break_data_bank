Orchestrator - responsible for the front-end interface. Handles requests for load runs from front-end, and orchestrates the various services to gather the pieces the demo needs.

endpoints:
/ [GET]
  - 

/test [GET, POST]
  - Debug endpoint, doesn't do anything specific, but was used in debugging various pieces

/fail [POST]
  - Used for first step of demo. Triggers a load generating run that is designed to fail the db instance it runs against (Cloud SQL small instance with highest level of intensity of traffic)
  - Returns an array of job codes (1) which will be the collection name in Firestore where the transaction values will be set
    - key: { jobs_id: [] }
  - Parameters
    - 'read_pattern' (required)
      - integer from 1-3, representing 3 different types of patterns:
        - 1: Consistent low frequency
        - 2: Consistent high frequency
        - 3: Spikey
    - 'write_pattern' (required)
      - integer from 1-3, representing 3 different types of patterns (same as above)

/run [POST]
  - Used for final step of demo. Triggers 3 load generating runs. One for each type of database (Cloud SQL, Cloud SQL w/ replication, Cloud Spanner)
  - Returns an array of job codes (3) which will be the collection name in Firestore where the transaction values will be set
    - key: { jobs_id: [] }
  - Parameters
    - 'read_pattern' (required)
    - 'write_pattern' (required)
    - 'intensity' (required)
      - How powerful the read/write patterns will be. Takes an integer between 1-3.
    - 'sql_size' (required)
      - Power level of the db's underlying machine. Takes an integer between 1-3.
    - 'sql_rep_size' (required)
    - 'spanner_size' (required)

/cached [POST]
  - Another way to run the demo. This, instead of accessing the db's directly to run the load generation, returns
  - Returns an array of job codes (depends on which mode that was sent, 1 or 3) which will be the collection name in Firestore where the transaction values will be set
    - key: { jobs_id: [] }
  - Parameters
    - 'mode' (required)
      - Takes a string "fail" or "run" depending on which mode is desired.
    - 'read_pattern' (required)
    - 'write_pattern' (required)
    - 'intensity' (required for run mode only)
    - 'sql_size' (required for run mode only)
    - 'sql_rep_size' (required for run mode only)
    - 'spanner_size' (required for run mode only)
